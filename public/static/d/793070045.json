For this one guys, there are like 40 options on Amazon. So what you want to do is find a book called \"Discreet Mathematics and Its Applications\". Unfortunately though some versions of this book cost $240 USD, but the good news is some only cost 40 cents. So it varies wildly, and really you can select any version at whatever price you can afford. Here is a direct amazon link to the search result where you can select from the price point you can afford. http://bit.ly/search-for-discrete-text-on-amazon\n- Analysis of Algorithms. For this one, I recommend this book http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1463417791&sr=8-3&keywords=analysis+of+algorithms which is about $60 USD.
